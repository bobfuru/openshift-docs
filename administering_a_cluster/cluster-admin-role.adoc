As an administrator of an {product-title} cluster with Customer Cloud Subscriptions (link:https://www.openshift.com/dedicated/ccs[CCS]),
you have access to the `cluster-admin` role. While logged in to an account with the `cluster-admin` role, users have mostly unrestricted
access to control and configure the cluster. There are some configurations that are blocked with webhooks to prevent destablizing
the cluster, or because they are managed in OpenShift Cluster Manager (link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[OCM]) and any in-cluster
changes would be overwritten. Usage of the `cluster-admin` role is subject to the restrictions listed in your
link:https://www.redhat.com/en/about/agreements[Appendix 4 agreement] with Red Hat.
